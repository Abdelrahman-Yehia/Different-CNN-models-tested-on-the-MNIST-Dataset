This is a study that compares between 40 CNN models using keras and python for image classification on the MNIST Dateset.
We observe how the results of the model change when specific parameters change.
The final model has accuracy around 98%.
The goal of this study is to understand how each parameters affect the accuracy of the model.
See The pdf file for explanation for the changes and also a spreadsheet comparing all the implemented models.
See the implementation of the final model in the .py file
